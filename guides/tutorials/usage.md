# Usage tutorial

This is a 5 minutes `SecretVault` tutorial that shows how to install
and configure `SecretVault`, and then create, delete, edit, and access
secrets in runtime.

### Install

Just add it into your dependencies like
```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:secret_vault, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Create priv dir

Just create a `priv` directory in the root of your project

### Configure

Configuration is straightforward. Minimal configuration would look
like this:

```elixir
import Config

config :my_app, :secret_vault,
  default: [password: System.fetch_env!("SECRET_VAULT_PASSWORD")]

# Here `default` is a name of a default prefix. Prefixes work like namespaces for secrets.
```


You can provide options other than
`password`. To see a full list of those check out the
`SecretVault.Config.new/2` documentation.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Each `MIX_ENV` will have it's own separate vault, so don't use
> prefixes to separate envs.

### Create secrets

To create a secret during development, you can use one of many secret
creating tasks available. But do not forget to provide the enviroment
variable with the password which we specified above.

For example,

```sh
$ export SECRET_VAULT_PASSWORD="password" # Don't forget to change the password value
$ mix scr.insert dev database_password "My Super Secret Password"
```

Or, to be able to write a password in your favourite editor, use

```sh
$ mix scr.create dev database_password
```

Here `dev` defines the `MIX_ENV` for which you'd like to create a
secret. And `database_password` is a name of the secret. These exact
commands will create a secret in
`priv/dev/default/database_password.vault_secret`. Each secret is
written onto it's own file in vault directory in `priv`. This plays
nice with version control systems and simplifies the user interface.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Each secret is written into it's own file with `.vault_secret`
> extension. Therefore, secrets' names must be suitable file names.

### Manipulate secrets

To edit already created secrets, one can use `mix scr.insert` and `mix
scr.edit` commands. To delete, rename or copy secrets, one
can use regular coreutils like `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, since each secret is
placed under the corresponding directory in `priv`. Usually the path
is `priv/$MIX_ENV/$PREFIX/${SECRET_NAME}.vault_secret`.

For example, to delete secret which was created in previous step, one
could write:

```sh
$ rm priv/dev/default/database_password.vault_secret
```

Or to rename a secret:
```sh
$ cd priv/dev/default/
$ mv database_password.vault_secret db_password.vault_secret
```

### Access secrets

To access and use secrets from `Elixir` application, one first need to
retrieve the vault configuration. Then, it is recommended to place the
secrets into some runtime storage (like `persistent_term`, for
example).

So, regular workflow would look like

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    ...
    {:ok, config} = SecretVault.Config.fetch_from_current_env(:my_app)
    SecretVault.Storage.to_persistent_term(config)
  end
end
```

This will create config from configuration of your application and put
all decrypted passwords in the `persistent_term`. See
`SecretVault.Config` and `SecretVault.Storage` for more options.

If you want to have you options in application env you can specify
this in `config.exs`

```elixir
# in config/config.exs
import Config

config :my_app, :secret_vault,
  default: [password: System.fetch_env!("SECRET_VAULT_PASSWORD")]

# in application.ex start function
{:ok, config} = SecretVault.Config.fetch_from_current_env(:my_app)
SecretVault.Storage.to_application_env(config)
```

### Runtime configuration

It is a common practice to configure application in configuration scripts like `config/config.exs`, `config/dev.exs` and `config/runtime.exs`. And there are two things
a developer must keep in mind while working with them

First of all, you **must not** use compile time configuration scritps (basically everything except `runtime.exs`) for setting values from secrets, since these values will appear in `app.src` file in your `_build` or release ebin directory. Usually, this is not something you can tolerate

Second, `runtime.exs` config will be called during initialization of your project and the enviroment of the project will be inherited from the enviroment which was during project compilation. This means, that for release created with `MIX_ENV=dev mix release` and called with
`MIX_ENV=prod myapp start`, secrets (and all other configuration) will be fetched from `dev` enviroment.

So, to configure secrets in runtime, you can write something like:

```
# in config/runtime.exs
import Config
import SecretVault, only: [runtime_secret!: 2]

config :playground, MyApp.Repo,
  password: runtime_secret(:playground, "database_password")
```

### Release

There is no special behaviour for releases. Just `mix release` and
use. Don't forget to add `mix scr.audit` task in your `CI` to enforce
quality of passwords.
